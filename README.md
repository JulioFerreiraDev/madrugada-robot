# The Madrugada Robot

This is a Logo-like educational programming environment which uses a real whiteboard to make a robot that draws on it. The pen simulates a turtle that walks around a 2D board, just like in the original Logo. The idea is to stimulate learning by means of a programmable physical robot.

The physical schemw and firmware was based on the drawing robot Makelangelo: http://www.makelangelo.com/

This project uses only open source software and hardware.
